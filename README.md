# Random-Web-Browser-WebView2
This project is pretty self-explanatory and I don't have very much energy to explain this project. You can get any chrome extension's files and import it into this browser with extension data saved but there is no ability to access them manually. Also I have no clue if I even imported this into GitHub correctly, anyway have fun!
