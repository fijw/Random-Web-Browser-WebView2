# Simple Web Browser (C#)
This project is pretty self-explanatory, and I don't have very much energy to explain this project. You can get any chrome extension's files and import them into the browser using the extensions folder, but there is no ability to access them manually via the browser. Also I have no clue if I even imported this into GitHub correctly, so have fun.
